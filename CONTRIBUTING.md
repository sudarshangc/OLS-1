In this project, we will be working with both students of developing countries and experts in computational biology to connect them through
a web based platform for mentorship so that they get benefitted from development of new skills which is lacking in developing countries.

Welcome all the changemakers! Your single contribution can help to make this project more better. Let you be recognized for your good work.
