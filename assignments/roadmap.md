## Roadmap

Connecting senior students and professionals in computational biology with the local Nepalese students and help them exchange important skills.

1. **Involving people (target audience)**

- [ ] To identify mentors and mentees in my community

**Tasks**

- [ ] Connect with the high school students and university students (mentees)
- [ ] Mentors will be people (not necessarily only Napalese - but will be beneficial) from the bioinformatics field who want to share their experiences and resources with younger students

2. **Design this platform for the target audience**

- [ ] Look for collaborators and contributors for co-designing
- [ ] Search existing similar platforms that can connect mentees and mentors, and reach out to the key people

**Tasks**

- [ ] Web developers/designers - invite them to join the team
- [ ] Ambassadors who can share information and talk about this

3. **Engaging with the target audience through the project/platform**

- [ ] Think of the schedule: what do you wanna talk about? What will people like to hear? Who would you invite?

**Tasks**

- [ ] Finalise a platform for calling (hosting a call) - a hangout for free (many people), Zoom call for 40 mins for free, Youtube    - Livestream
   - Invite these mentees 
   - Survey: what do you wanna learn about?
   - Career
   - Bioinformatics specific topic
   - Study/education/research
